        <p>We're not able to offer test kits if you're under 16. You'll need to see a health professional to get tested.</p>

        <p>They'll ask you about your sexual activity.</p>
      <p>You or they take samples from the areas that might be infected. This may be done by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>wiping a cotton bud inside your vagina, anus or mouth</li>
        <li>peeing into a container</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tests are free, and treatment is free if you need it. You'll usually get your results by phone or text message within 2 weeks. Your results are private.</p>
        "
      }) }}

      <p>The health professional will also want to check you're safe. They won't tell anyone you saw them, or share what you said - unless they're worried about your safety.</p>
      <p>They'll usually speak to you before asking for help from anyone else.</p>
